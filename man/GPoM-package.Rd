\title{GPoM package: Generalized Polynomial Modelling}
\description{
GPoM is a platform dedicated to the Global Modelling
technique. Its aim is to obtain deterministic models of
Ordinary Differential Equations from observational time series.
It applies to single and to multiple time series.
With single time series, it can be used:
to detect low-dimnesional determinism and low-dimensional
(deterministic) chaos. It can also be used to
characterize the observed behavior, using the obtained
models as a proxy of the original dynamics,
as far as the model validation could be checked.
With multiple time series, it can be used:
to detect couplings between observed variables,
to infer causal networks,
and to reformulate the original equations of the observed
system (retro-modelling).
The present package focuses on models in Ordinary Differential
Equations of polynomial form.
The package was designed to model weakly predictable dynamical
behaviors (such as chaotic behaviors).
Of course, it can also apply to more of fully predictable
behavior, either linear or nonlinear.
Several vignettes are associated to the package
which can be used as a tutorial,
and it also provides an overlook of the diversity
of applications and at the performances of the tools.
Users are kindly asked to quote the corresponding
references when using the package (see hereafter).

\note{
FOR USERS \cr
This package was developped at Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de
la Biosphere (Cesbio, UMR 5126, UPS-CNRS-CNES-IRD,
http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr).
An important part of the developments were funded by
the French program Les Enveloppes Fluides et l'Environnement
(LEFE, MANU, projets GloMo, SpatioGloMo and MoMu).
The French program DÃ©fi InFiNiTi (CNRS) and PNTS
are also acknowledged (projects Crops'IChaos and Musc & SlowFast).

If you apply this package to single time series,
please quote [6].
If you apply it to multivariate time series,
please quote [10].
If you apply it to infer couplings among
time series, please quote [8].
If you apply it to classification, please quote [11].

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND \cr
The global modelling technique was initiated during
the early 1990s [1-3]. It takes its background from
the Theory of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems.
Earlier investigations can also be found in the fields
of Electrical Engineering and Statistics but these
mainly focused on linear problems [4].
The approach became applicable to the analysis of real world
environmental behaviours by the end of the 2000s [5-7].
Recent works have shown that the approach could be applied to
numerous other dynamical behaviors [8-10].
Global modelling aims to obtain deterministic models
directly from observed time series.
