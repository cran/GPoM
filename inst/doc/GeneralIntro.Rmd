## Generalized Global Polynomial Modelling (GPoM)

Didactic file to learn how to use GPoM package

GPoM is an R package dedicated to global modelling.
The aim of global modelling is to obtain Ordinary
Differential Equations
for dynamical systems, directly from time series
and without any other a priori knowledge.
Global modelling was developped to model
low-dimensional chaos.
For this reason, it is well adapted to model
deterministic behaviours from linear to strongly
nonlinear. And it is also well designed to model
dynamical behaviour characterized by a high sentivity
to the initial conditions.

The global modelling technique was initiated in
the early 1990s^[J. P. Crutchfield and B. S. McNamara, 1987. Equations 
of motion from a data series, Complex Syst. 1, 417-452.],
and its first illustrations were obained thanks to
a formalism developped by G. Gouesbet and his
colleagues^[G. Gouesbet & J. Maquet, 1992. Construction
of phenomenological models from numerical scalar time
series, Physica D, 58, 202-215.], ^[G. Gouesbet & C. Letellier,
1994. Global vector-field reconstruction by using a multivariate
polynomial L2 approximation on nets, Phys. Rev. E 49, 4955-4972.].
It is observed that our ability to obtain equations
for one chosen system may be very different depending
on what variable is used to reconstruct the equations.
This property plays a very important role when
trying to retrieve governing equations for any
dynamical system.
This question was investigated during
the last decades^[C. Letellier, L. A. Aguirre, &
J. Maquet, 2005. Relation between observability
and differential embeddings for nonlinear dynamics,
Phys. Rev. E 71, 066213.].

Although its developments started in the early
1990s, it is only in middle of the 2000s that
a set of ordinary differential equations could be
obtained from real world data set^[J. Maquet,
C. Letellier & L. A. Aguirre 2007. Global models
from the Canadian Lynx cycles as a first evidence
for chaos in real ecosystems, J. Math. Biol.
55(1), 21-39.].
New algorithms were developped at the begining
of the 2010s^[S. Mangiarotti, R. Coudret, L. Drapeau
& L. Jarlan, 2012. Polynomial search and global modeling:
Two algorithms for modeling chaos,” Phys. Rev. E, 86(4),
046205.] that proved to have very good skills to model
dynamical behaviors observed under real environmental
conditions: cereal crops cycles, snow area cycles,
eco-epidemiology, etc.^[S. Mangiarotti, L. Drapeau &
C. Letellier, 2014. Two chaotic global models for cereal
crops cycles observed from satellite in Northern Morocco,
Chaos, 24, 023130.], ^[S. Mangiarotti, Modélisation globale
et caractérisation topologique de dynamiques environnementales:
de l'analyse des enveloppes fluides et du couvert de surface
de la Terre à la caractérisation topolodynamique du
chaos, Habilitation to Direct Researches, Université de
Toulouse 3, 2014.], etc.

All these developments were initialy developped
to model dynamical behavior from single time series.
Recent developments have shown that the global
modelling technique could also be applied to
model multivariate couplings^[S. Mangiarotti, 2015. Low
dimensional chaotic models for the plague epidemic in
Bombay, Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 81(A), 184-196.], ^[S.
Mangiarotti, M. Peyre & M. Huc, 2016.
A chaotic model for the epidemic of Ebola virus disease
in West Africa (2013–2016). Chaos, 26, 113112.].

The present package provides global modeling
tools for modelling linear and nonlinear behaviors
from observed time series.

To introduce the package, five other illustrative
`vignettes` are provided to introduce how to apply
the global modelling technique from observational
data. These are as follows:

1) `I_Generate` aims to introduce the convention
used to formulate sets of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
of polynomial form with GPoM and to show how to integrate
it numerically.

2) `II_PreProcessing` provides some simple
examples of time series preprocessing before applying
the global modelling technique.

3) `III_Modelling` is dedicated to the global
modelling itself. Several case studies are presented
considering single and multiple time series, both for
modelling or detecting causal couplings.

4) `IV_VisuOutput` shows how to get an overview
of the output results obtained with global modelling
functions and how outputs are organised.

5) `V_Predictability` aims to provide basic examples
of validation considering the models skills in term of
predictability.

The present GPoM package is made available to whom
would like to use it.
It includes most of the latest developments presently
available to apply the global modelling technique,
and we are happy to share it with you.
Please refer to the following publications When 
using the present tools:

series modelling,

[2] Mangiarotti 2015 for infering causality and for
detecting or analysing multivariate couplings,

formulation of global modelling technique (that is
combining multiariate time series and derivatives).

about the results and interpretations obtained and made
by other users.
